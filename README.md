# AFP2-RNA-Seq
RNA-Seq data and analysis of an Arabidopsis mutant overexpressing AFP2, a transcription factor that represses abscisic acid response by interacting with ABI5. 
Mutants and WT seeds are observed in three conditions: control media, exposure to abscisic acid (ABA), and exposure to trichostatin A (TSA).

The original hypothesis was that AFP2 represses ABI5 in part by recruiting histone deactylases. If HDACs are inhibited by trichostatin A, AFP2 repression would also be inhibited.
The original hypothesis has mostly been rejected, but there are some clusters that do fit the pattern 
(differential expression between Y-AFP2 and WT in GM and ABA, but not in TSA)

In general TSA has very broad effects, and the experiment might benefit from more specific HDAC inhibitors.

As a whole we saw what we would expect to see: 
ABA specifically regulates things like lipid storage, response to cold, cell homeostasis, and response to water.
